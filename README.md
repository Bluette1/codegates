# codegates

* Contains solutions to problems at [Codility](https://app.codility.com) in java.
 
* Solutions are contained in `src` package folder for example:

  * src/main/java/Iterations

* Tests are contained in `test` package folder for example:

  *  src/test/java/Iterations

## Tips for Coding:
  * Always make sure you understand the **requirements** of the problem.
  * Take the time to read and understand the actual problem before you start coding the solution:- a problem well understood is a problem half-solved.
  * Aim at **working less** and instead **working smarter**. Efficiency matters and so does asymptotic running time.
  * Pay attention to **edge cases**
  * Have a **clear-cut thought process/strategy** for solving problems and **document every step** while doing as much "outside-of-the box" thinking as possible to gain maximum understanding of the problem at hand.
  * Have patience: use the **elimination principal** (all scientists and engineers do) As Sherlock Holmes pointed out, “When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.” (A. Conan Doyle, The Sign of Four), collect as many possible clues and ideas as possible and don't discard possible hints and solutions too soon, otherwise you may blame yourself for not being as smart as you thought were by overlooking the correct answer:-) 
  * Always **review** your work to make sure that's the best way of doing it and that there are no bugs.
  * Swallow your pride and look out for **lessons learned** at the end of each coding session.  Being both learned and continuously learning will eventually turn anyone into an expert. Don't stick with what doesn't work. Moving on is a part of life. Never give up! Keep going no matter what.
  * Pursue **Active/Kinesthetic learning** as opposed to passive learning. **Practice** makes perfect. Overall the engineering philosophy is pragmatic. Let your newly acquired knowledge move you. Many wonders in life although seemingly suddenly born really happen gradually over time. This has something to do with *habit keeping* and the concept of *commitment / showing up*. Think of a mother patiently nurturing an infant in her womb for 9 months and then giving birth. The miracle of procreation did not happen overnight! Allow time for your knowledge to incubate.
  * Aim at having at least *a focused hour of coding each day*; you don't have to have a long chunk of time within which you can code.
  * Learn *Functional Programming* languages like Haskell.
  * **Curiosity** (women are gifted in this: focus on *why* you think it is or not working) and **Skepticism** are great strengths in coding and testing.
  **Intuition**. Read "A Mind At Play". Basically Big Picture mentality works. Trust and follow your intuition more often (Again women are gifted in this area). Don't allow yourself to get confused and murked up in small disarranged and misleading facts. Understand the problem and even name / rename it before trying to tackle it.

#### How To Solve Problems Like a Genius
* I have found it boils down to applying these two tactics carefully:
###### Form a structure or framework within which to work on the problem
This is the big picture, otherwise known as intuitive reasoning
###### Break it down and harness / own it without getting lost in details
* How do you eat an elephant? Bit by bit. How do you manage complexity? As simple as it sounds, the answer is keep it simple. How do you deal with complexity? Break it down. Breaking down seemingly difficult problems into smaller and simpler subproblems is a great way to dissect a problem in order to form patterns and gain intuition required to solve more complex problems. Complexity is built from basic patterns / repetitions. 
###### Apply Creative / Random / Dynamic / Kinesthetic Reasoning (Multiply, Divide, Subtract, Add; Explore all options; Move around) Versus Critical / Logical / Static / Tunnel Vision
* Look up (rising above own prejudices and limitations) 
* *Have I built Knowledge and Awareness?* Have I risen above my first assumption? How and when? If you are experiencing problems recalling how and when, you probably need to go back to the beginning.
* Look down (back to earth). Does the proposed solution approach the problem from all angles?
* Look left (Practicing inclusivity): Have I established the requirements of the problem. Have I clarified them with the source?
* Look Right (Before crossing): Is this the best solution to the problem? Have I refactored my code if necessary?
* Multiply / Quantify your ideas / possibilities. Stretch your imagination and reasoning as far as possible. Try to think of all possible cases / input, including edge cases.
###### Practice what you have learnt by using this strategy that above all allows for both scientific as well as creative reasoning.
###### Statistics matter: Be sure to keep a record of the most commonly made mistakes, for example when if you normally type '>' instead of '>=', you can note this in your list. When you encounter a bug, you can tick off of this list.

#### Above All: Code With Love
* Pay attention to **how you feel** when you are coding. You are most productive when you are happiest. Coding with love will allow you to code love into your programs. 
* Make it fun and try to balance. Apply some **rhythm**. Make it a dance pattern. Rhythm is embedded in nature. Let nature work for you. Take some *timely breaks* if you have to, and then resume when you can. Even if you love what you do you have to be wise enough to take some rest from your work.
